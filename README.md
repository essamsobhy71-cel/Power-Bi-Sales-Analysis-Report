# Power-Bi-Sales-Analysis-Report
This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of retail sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends. The data was transformed into a star-schema model consisting of a fact table and supporting dimension tables (Date, Customer, Category, and Products) to enable efficient filtering, drill-down, and time intelligence calculations.

The report highlights key performance indicators including Total Sales, Average Order Value, Cancellation and Refund Rates, Top Performing Categories, Returning Customers Percentage, and Month-over-Month Growth.
It also includes trend visualizations to evaluate sales behavior over time, identify peak periods, and compare current performance with previous periods.

This dashboard enables decision-makers to:

Understand which product categories drive the highest revenue

Monitor customer purchase frequency and retention

Evaluate order fulfillment vs canceled/refunded orders

Track time-based growth trends and performance shifts

Overall, the project demonstrates strong skills in:
Data Cleaning, Dimensional Modeling, DAX Calculations, KPI Development, Time Intelligence Analysis, and Dashboard Visualization using Power BI.
